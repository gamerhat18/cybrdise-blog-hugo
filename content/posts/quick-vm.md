# Quick-VM

Windows 10 is used by many, in personal computers, enterprise, workstations, etc. Not because it is the best, nor because it is the fastest, or the most secure, but only because most do not know about the alternatives.

Some of the practical problems including but not limited to:

1. The latest windows update has even proved to be devastating for computers running Windows 10, as many users were stuck with a non-functioning computer altogether.

2. Windows Deleting your important files without your consent, which happened twice.

3. Security, or the lack thereof. **Millions of new Viruses and Malware EVERY MONTH**. Absolutely not worth explaining further, as everyone of us is aware about it.
